# Fight Goblins, not Servers™

Welcome to the translations repository for [The Forge](https://forge-vtt.com).
This repository allows for integration with community translation management solutions.

### Configuration
- `en` (English) is the source language
- Each language has three namespaces: 
  - `server`
  - `client`
  - `common`
- Language files are located in `locales/{language}/{namespace}.json`
