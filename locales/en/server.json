Duty not to prevent normal idling of the Foundry server\n1. We automatically idle servers when there is no activity from the users. This automatic idling saves on resource usage, and helps serve our customers better while using our services.\n2. You may not use scripts or other tools to simulate activity, if you are not actually using the server. By preventing auto-idling, you obstruct our services and adversely affect our business. We reserve the right to cancel your subscription without refund, and ban your account in the event we detect such activity.\n\n## 9. Duty to maintain security of Account\n1. You must not share your account details with anyone and must not sell, transfer or allow any other person to access your account.\n2.

You are solely responsible and liable for the actions on your account without your knowledge.\n4. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.\n5. You agree not to share your account’s subscription with multiple people in independent groups for the purposes of decreasing subscription costs. We reserve the right to cancel your subscription without refund, and ban your account in the event of detecting such activity.\n\n## 10. Subscription Terms\n1. **Auto-renewal Terms:**\n   1. We provide an automatic 14-day free trial to our service, which is activated at the first time you subscribe to a plan.\n   2. During this free trial, you will not be charged.\n   3. During the free trial you may change your subscription option at no cost, and may also cancel the subscription.\n   4. Once the free trial has elapsed and you have not cancelled the subscription, your payment method will be automatically billed according to the last subscription plan chosen in the free trial period.\n2. **Cancellation of Service:**\n   1. Once you subscribe to our services, your subscription will auto-renew and your payment method will be automatically billed at the end of each billing cycle.\n   2. If you do not wish to renew your subscription you may cancel your subscription any time by cancelling on the account page during the existing subscription period. Your subscription will remain active until the end of the billing cycle even if you have cancelled your subscription before the end of the billing cycle. Your subscription will not be auto-renewed once you have canceled.\n   3. Please note no partial refunds will be given for cancelling the subscription prior to the end of the billing cycle.\n   4. Cancelling of your subscription will not excuse any ongoing liabilities, unpaid subscription dues, or other fees related to your use of our services.\n3. **Data add-on:** Similar to the provision of cancellation of service, data addons purchased annually will remain active for the entire year even if cancelled early. Please note that there will not be any partial refund for cancellation of data addons.\n4. **Downgrading:** If you downgrade your subscription, the new changes will take effect only after your current subscription ends on your billing date. Your existing subscription will remain active until the renewal date and no partial refund will be issued.\n5. **Upgrading:** If you upgrade your subscription, the subscription is renewed immediately and your billing date is refreshed. Any unused time on the previous subscription will be given back as credit towards the new subscription and will be calculated on a prorated basis from the moment the upgrade is confirmed.\n6. **Payment Mode:** You may pay for subscriptions through credit cards or debit cards including Visa, Mastercard and American Express or via PayPal. All payments are processed securely via Stripe.\n7. **Disputes:** In the event of a successful payment dispute against our company, we reserve the right to immediately cancel your subscription, and ban your account from our service.\n\n## 11. Ownership\n1. Company has proprietary rights in respect to services provided by it. Company provides only a license to the users to use the services and does not transfer any proprietary or ownership rights to the users. Users agree that all logos and marks displayed to users are intellectual property rights of the Company or of the third-party associates of the Company.\n2. All content you share on the forum such as your account information, posts, or other content you submit to the forum shall belong to you and we reserve a right to copy, publish and analyze content you submit to the forum. By agreeing to this Agreement, you hereby provide us a license to use your content as mentioned above. We also have a right to delete any content you post if it violates any term contained herein or if we have received a DMCA request to delete your content. You agree not to wrongly imply that the content you submit to the forum is sponsored, endorsed or approved by the Company.\n3. When your content is removed from the forum, whether by you or by the Company, the Company’s license ends when the last copy disappears from the Company’s backups, caches, and other systems.\n4. Company shall not be responsible for misuse of your content by others in the forum. You agree to use Company’s services with the knowledge that other users of the forum have access to your content and you undertake to release Company from any liability arising from the misuse of your content.\n\n## 12.

We shall not be responsible for any mishandling of payments by other party payment processors. We have reasonably chosen the payment processors. However, we do not have any control over their actions and you agree to release us from any liability arising from your use of the payment processors to pay for our services.\n4. Any claim in respect of our products or services shall be made only against us without involving our payment processors and all claims regarding mishandling of payments shall be exclusively made against the payment processors without involving us. In case you make a claim against payment processors in respect of our products or services, you shall be liable for all losses suffered by us resulting from your claim against the payment processor.\n5.
